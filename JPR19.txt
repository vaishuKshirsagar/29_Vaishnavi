19) Consider the following code snippet.

if (aNumber >= 0)
    if (aNumber == 0)
        System.out.println("first string");
else System.out.println("second string");
System.out.println("third string");

a) What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3?
Answer:- second string
                 third string

b) Write a test program containing the previous code snippet; make aNumber 
3. What is the output of the program?
 Is it what you predicted? Explain why the output is what it is; in other words, 
what is the control flow for the code snippet?
Answer:- second string 
                third string
 It is a nested if else example first the code will start to execute from the first if statement 3
is greater than equal to 0 then in the second 3 is not equals to 0 so else part will be executed.
and then third print statement will get printed since it is outside the if statement 

c) Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make the control flow 
easier to understand.   
Answer:- 
      if (aNumber >= 0)
           if (aNumber == 0)
           System.out.println("First string"); 
           else
           System.out.println("Second string");
 
     System.out.println("Third string")

d) Use braces, { and }, to further clarify the code
Answer:- 
        
         if (aNumber >= 0)
          {
                if (aNumber == 0) {
                 System.out.println("First string"); }
                else {
           System.out.println("Second string"); }
           }
         System.out.println("Third string")
